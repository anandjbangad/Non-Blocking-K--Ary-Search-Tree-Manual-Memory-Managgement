# Non-Blocking-K--Ary-Search-Tree-Manual-Memory-Management
This work presents the generalization of a Concurrent Binary Search Tree to a Non-Blocking leaf oriented Concurrent K-Ary Search Tree in Java. I have used single-word compare-and-set operations to coordinate updates to the tree. Further we extend the implementation to work without Javaâ€™s garbage collector for manual memory management. We use the concept of thread local pool of pre-allocated nodes for the memory management. The potential ABA problem that arises is taken care by using AtomicStampedRefference
